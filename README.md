01.INTRODUCTION

A Wireless sensor network (WNS) is defined as tiny detectives or small embedded devices called sensors that communicate with each other wirelessly following an ad-hoc configuration. 
The Shared Sensor Networks separate each sensor network for each task and suggest using one big network that multiple applications can tap into, which is protected from unauthorized users.So, the security algorithm keeps the data safe and only authorized users can access it.
These security algorithms help in:-
1} It should make sure the information each sensor collects is secure and does not get accessed by anyone who shouldn’t.
2} Check whether the data hasn’t interfered or changed from being sent from one place to another.
3}By keeping track of who’s accessing the network, only authorized users are allowed to join in and share their data.
By using these security algorithms, shared sensor networks can operate smoothly and securely, free from the worries of hackers trying to compromise the integrity of the network or steal valuable information.


02.OBJECTIVE 

Implementing security algorithms in a shared sensor network is aimed to address various challenges and ensure the robustness, integrity, and confidentiality of the network and its data. 
Some of the objectives include:-

1}Data Confidentiality: 
The security algorithms aim to prevent the data from unauthorized access within the shared sensor network. Only authorized parties can decipher the data, access the information, and protect it from bugs or eavesdropping.

2}Data Integrity: 
To ensure integrity is important to maintain the trust in a shared sensor network. Security algorithms use some special tools like hash functions and digital signatures to detect and prevent the data received.

3}Access Control:
It is essential for regulating the benefits and permissions that are granted to different users within the shared sensor network. Security algorithms enable the implementation of access policies, restricting access to sensitive data which ensures that only authorized entities can interact with specific data minimizing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse.
